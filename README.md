# Generative-Adversarial-Models-in-Lasagne-and-Theano
Toy example implementing GAN using MNIST dataset, on theano and Lasagne tooloboxes 

The code follows pseudo code of the original paper 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661


# To execute 
download the file the GAN_Lasagne.py and the data mnist.npz 
type
python GAN_Lasagne.py

# Very basic network for generator and as well as for the discriminator 

# Few images from the experiment are also uploaded
